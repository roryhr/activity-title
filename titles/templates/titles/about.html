<h1>About Activity Title</h1>

<section class="about-intro">
    <p>
        Tired of generic activity titles like "Afternoon Run"? Activity Title lets you pre-write creative titles and effortlessly apply them to your Strava activities.  Inspired by TweetDeck's scheduling features, this app helps you inject personality into your training log.
    </p>
    <p>
        This project was a fun opportunity to build a Django app, explore the Strava API and webhooks, and even leverage the power of ChatGPT! While currently a personal project connected to my own Strava account, the goal is to expand access in the future.
