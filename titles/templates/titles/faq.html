<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<section class="faq">
    <h2>General</h2>
    <details>
        <summary>What is Activity Title?</summary>
        <p>Activity Title is a web application that allows you to create and manage custom names for future Strava
            activities. It's designed to replace generic activity names like "Afternoon Run" with more creative and
            personalized ones.

            This was inspired by TweetDeck which enabled power users to schedule tweets back when Twitter didn't have
            that feature.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Where's the AI?</summary>
        <p>There's no AI here. You need to come up with your own names. All we do is store and sync them.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>How does it work?</summary>
        <p>You create and save activity titles in advance. When you upload a new activity to Strava, Activity Title
            automatically updates it with your chosen title via Strava's webhook API.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Is Activity Title free?</summary>
        <p>Yes! This website is a one-trick pony that doesn't cost much to run. You can support me at <a

    <details>
        <summary>What Strava permissions does Activity Title require?</summary>

    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>What happens to my Strava data?</summary>
        <p>Activity Title only stores your activity titles and the associated Strava activity ID. No other Strava data
            is stored. We don't change your privacy settings.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>What happens if I don't authorize Activity Title to view my private activities?</summary>
