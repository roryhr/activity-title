<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<section class="faq">
    <h2>General</h2>
    <details>
        <summary>What is Activity Title?</summary>
        <p>Activity Title is a web application that allows you to create and manage custom names for future Strava
            activities. It's designed to replace generic activity names like "Afternoon Run" with more creative and
            personalized ones.

            This was inspired by TweetDeck which enabled power users to schedule tweets back when Twitter didn't have
            that feature.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>How does it work?</summary>
        <p>You create and save activity titles in advance. When you upload a new activity to Strava, Activity Title
            automatically updates it with your chosen title via Strava's webhook API.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Is Activity Title free?</summary>
        <p>Currently, Activity Title is a personal project and is not publicly available. I plan to open access in the
            future.</p>
    </details>

    <h2>Strava Integration</h2>
    <details>
        <summary>What Strava permissions does Activity Title require?</summary>
        <p>Activity Title requires permission to read and write activity data. This is necessary to update your activity
            titles.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>What happens to my Strava data?</summary>
        <p>Activity Title only stores your activity titles and the associated Strava activity ID. No other Strava data
            is stored. We don't change your privacy settings.</p>
