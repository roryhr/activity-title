<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<section class="faq">
    <h2>General</h2>
    <details>
        <summary>What is Activity Title?</summary>
        <p>Activity Title is a web application that allows you to create and manage custom titles for your Strava
            activities. It's designed to replace generic activity names with more creative and personalized ones.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>How does it work?</summary>
        <p>You create and save activity titles in advance. When you upload a new activity to Strava, Activity Title
            automatically updates it with your chosen title via Strava's webhook API.</p>
