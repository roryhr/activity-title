# Strava Deck? 

This is a Django web app that renames Strava activities.
You create them here, they're saved to a database, and then they'll get applied one-by-one automatically within minutes once a Strava activity is created.

That's it! It's free so check it out at

# Development

I'm using Python 3.11 and Django.

```
conda create -n py311 python=3.11
conda activate py311
pip install -r requirements.txt 

python manage.py runserver 
```

Code formatting is handled by `black .` 

Static files are handled by whitenoise.
